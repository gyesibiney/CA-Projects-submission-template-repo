## Project Description
...Business Understanding
In order to comprehend the factors that lead to start-up success, the problem entails analyzing the funding received by start-ups in India from 2018 to 2021. The objective is to find patterns and trends in the data on financing amounts, investor details, and start-up information and to use these revelations to make inferences about the traits of Indian start-ups that are likely to succeed. Utilizing statistical techniques and methods, the study may look at the effects of start-up performance on funding levels, investor diversity, location, industry specialization, innovation, and founding team experience. Investors, business people, and policy makers who want to comprehend the dynamics of the Indian start-up ecosystem and come up with ideas such as start-up promotion may find the analysis' findings helpful.

## Setup
...Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally.
You need to have [`Python 3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system (**a Python version lower than 3.10**). Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's `root :: repository_name> ...`  follow the steps below:


- Windows *(Python should be added to the Path variable of environment)*:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt  

- Linux & MacOs:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol **;** but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

## App Execution
...This evaluation will be automatically grade, so please follow the instructions carefully. 

You can run this command bellow being at the root of the repository to be sure your solutions are the good ones before to push your solutions.
```command
```
