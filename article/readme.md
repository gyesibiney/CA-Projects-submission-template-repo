•	INTRODUCTION
Basically, a startup company is a young company with a business model that simply supports innovation. These companies are very pivotal as far as the development of a country is concerned. Thus, they primarily meet the demands of a growing economy. Hence, we can boldly conclude that the influx of such companies in a particular domain or ecosystem is a measure of the extent that domain will thrive. 

This project is to document a systematic approach to analyzing the Indian startup’s ecosystem annually using python from 2018 - 2021. This analysis follows the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data mining (CRIPS-DM) approach.

1.	Objectives:
The objective of this project is to give insights to key stakeholders, management to make informed decisions, and investors aiming to venture into the Indian startup ecosystem.  All of this can be possible by analyzing data on funding received by these companies from 2018 – 2021 as a standard measurement.

Furthermore, the project was validated using the hypothesis to test the dataset. Thus, technological and technological industries, are more likely to receive funding from investors.

## Hypothesis
Null Hypothesis: Investment in the Indian ecosystem is not biased towards any of the sectors

Altenate Hypothesis: Investments in the Indian ecosystem is biased towards at least one sector

## Questions
- Are start-ups located in specific areas more likely to succeed or to receive more financing than those located other areas?
- Has the amount of investments in the ecosystem increased over the 4 year span (the datasets we are looking at), or has it decreased?
- What is the median investment amount received by Indian startups at different stages of their growth?
- Does the nature of the industry has any impact on the amount of funding received?
- Which startup (s) had the highest rate/count of funding (this counts the startup that occured most but not with duplicate funding)
